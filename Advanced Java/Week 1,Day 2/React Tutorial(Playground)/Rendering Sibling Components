// Adjacent elements canâ€™t be rendered like this in React 
// because each of them gets translated into a function call when JSX gets converted. You have a few options to deal with this issue.

// First, you can pass an array of elements to ReactDOM.render and insert into that array as many React elements as you wish.
ReactDOM.render([<Button />, <Display />], mountNode);

// Another option is to make the sibling React elements the children of another React element. For example, we can just enclose them in a div element.
ReactDOM.render(
  <div>
    <Button />
    <Display />
  </div>,
  mountNode
);

// React has a special object if you need to enclose multiple adjacent elements like this without introducing a new DOM parent node. You can use React.Fragment:
ReactDOM.render(
  <React.Fragment>
    <Button />
    <Display />
  </React.Fragment>,
  mountNode
);

// Another option
ReactDOM.render(
  <>
    <Button />
    <Display />
  </>,
  mountNode
);
